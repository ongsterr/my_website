### **The Idea**
---
The portfolio website was built to accomplish **3 goals**:
* Introduce my story
* Allow users to get something out of my story
* Invite users to be part of my future story

The portfolio website was built targeting a few users:
* Recruiters
* Prospective Employers
* Prospective Partners
* Venture Capitalists

The theme of the website is:
> "Every person has a story."

### **Design Philosophy**
---
Priority #1: **User Experience (UX)**
* Content should be structured to help put life into a page - giving a face, sound and impression into a page
    * This is to solve the long standing issue of a paper resume - lack of expression
* Content should be presented in a chronological order - just like how a story is being told
* Content structure should encourage users to have a complete experience of the website (from start to finish)

Priority #2: **User Interphase (UI)**
* Design should be simple - ideally using only up to 4 colors
* Design should make a strong impression

Design inspirations were mainly sourced from Pinterest:

### **Development Journey**
---
* **Planning Phase**
    1. Defining website objectives and identifying target audience
    2. Defining design philosophy for UX and UI of website
    3. Gathering design inspirations from pinterest

* **Development Phase**
    1. Draft structure of website to best convey my message
    2. Develop content for website
    3. Build website design through iterations in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/JlAvL3VMY6hyv8KuhYddJhII/Portfolio-Project)

    4. Start with *mobile design* and then the *tablet/desktop* design
        * **Key question:** How do I best present my content in the available real estate?

    5. Set up repository and add all related files to [Github](https://github.com/ongsterr/my_website).

    6. Start coding the **mobile design**
        *   Started with building the structure in HTML by considering the best CSS display tool to use i.e. Should I use **CSS grid**, **CSS flexbox** or **CSS block/inline-block** to structure the design of my content?
        * While coding website for mobile, there were a few going back and forth to the drawing board in Figma and coding mainly due to the dilemma between content and design

    7. Start coding the **desktop design**
        * **Original idea:** Scale the mobile design to best fit the tablet/desktop
        * **Lesson:** This is not a good idea!
        * **Improvement:** The arrangement of content needs to be updated to better fit the increased real estate
            * Structure of HTML is essential here - with proper planning of the HTML/CSS structure while coding the mobile design, it will be easier to scale to the desktop design

* **Closing Phase**
    1. Finalise the documentations related to the website development i.e. this "readme"
    2. Maintain a list of future development, timeline and future actions

### **Key Lessons**
---
* Setting scope of project by stages is very important. By setting scope by stages, you can systematically strive for perfection yet not sacrificing "completing the task"
    > As someone once said, "Completed is better than perfect."
* Always have users in mind while developing - both content and design
    > "People ignore designs that ignores people." - Frank Chimero
* Planning the structure of HTML and CSS mobile design first but with tablet/desktop design in mind is essential.
    > "By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail." - Benjamin Franklin

### **What's Next?**
---
* Additional improvements to the website:
    * Re-design tablet/desktop version to better use the available real estate
    * Add custom domain to better improve web address recognition/branding
    * Add meta tags for sharing "snippets"
    * Improve website security through upgrading to "HTTPS"
    * Optimize website loading speed to ensure smoother user experience, or add loading page where necessary
